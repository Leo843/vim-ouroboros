INTRODUCTION                                    *ouroboros*

This plugin allows the user to replace the word under cursor by other words with
related (often symmetrical) meanings (e.g. true/false, begin/end, insert/remove,
one/two/three/..., ...). The replacement is performed cyclically based on a list
of words defined in a database file.

ENTRYPOINT                                      *ouroboros-entrypoint*

The entry point of the plugin is the function called Ouroboros(). No default
mapping is provided, the user has to define one in order to use the plugin. Here
is an example of such mapping using <leader>o as keyboard shortcut.

  nmap <silent> <leader>o :call Ouroboros()<CR>

DATABASE                                        *ouroboros-database*

The database containing replacement words is a file whose location is set in
variable g:ouroboros_db. By default the location is set to
$HOME/.vim/ouroboros.db. The user can change this location as shown below.

  let g:ouroboros_db='$HOME/.vim/path/to/file'
