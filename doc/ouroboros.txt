INTRODUCTION                                    *ouroboros*

This plugin allows the user to replace the word under cursor by other words with
related (often symmetrical) meanings (e.g. true/false, begin/end, insert/remove,
one/two/three/..., ...). The replacement is performed cyclically based on a list
of words defined in a database file.

ENTRYPOINT                                      *ouroboros-entrypoint*

The entry point of the plugin is the function called Ouroboros(). No default
mapping is provided, the user has to define one in order to use the plugin. Here
is an example of such mapping using <leader>o as keyboard shortcut.

  nmap <silent> <leader>o :call Ouroboros()<CR>

DATABASE                                        *ouroboros-database*

The databases containing replacement words is a list of files and their
locations are set in global variable g:ouroboros_db. By default the list
contained one location set to <plugin-path>/db/ouroboros.db. The user can change
this location as shown below.

  let g:ouroboros_db=['path/to/first/file','path/to/second/file']

Databases defined in g:ouroboros_db applied to all buffers by default. However,
this behavior can be changed for a buffer by setting b:ouroboros_db with a list
of files to use for this buffer instead of the global databases. This can be
automated by setting b:ouroboros_db in files defined in ftplugin/. The example
below set a specific database for cpp files.

  ~/.vim/ftplugin/cpp.vim
    1
    2 let b:ouroboros_db=['~/.ouroboros_cpp.db']
